# ElevateLabs-Cybersecurity-Task-2
Analyze a Phishing Email Sample

Tools Used
- Visual inspection of email screenshot
- Email header analysis concepts (SPF/DKIM/DMARC – theoretical due to screenshot format and.txt file)
- Awareness of phishing indicators
- Microsoft Word (to document the findings)
Steps Performed
1. Sender Email Analysis – Verified if the sender's domain is legitimate. In this case, the email came from an unrelated domain (.cl), indicating spoofing.
2. Header Analysis – Since only a screenshot was provided, we inferred likely authentication issues (SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures) based on the domain and structure.
3. Link & Attachment Check – Evaluated the call-to-action button with hidden link that is likely malicious, directing the user to a phishing page.
4. Urgent Language Detection – The email content included phrases like 'temporary suspension' and a timestamp, typical of phishing emails using social engineering tactics.
5. URL Mismatch Check – Noted that the sender domain and the claimed brand (American Express) do not align, and that links are hidden under suspicious CTAs.
6. Grammar and Spelling Review – Identified errors such as 'untill' and unprofessional tone, which are common in phishing messages.
7. Summary and Report Generation – Documented all findings in a structured format, including a final conclusion marking the email as phishing.
Conclusion: The analysis successfully identified multiple phishing indicators in the suspicious email. These findings were compiled into a detailed report to enhance cybersecurity awareness and skills.
Outcome: Awareness of phishing tactics and email threat analysis skills.
